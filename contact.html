	  <h2>Preferred Way: <a id="email">Email</a></h2>
	  <p>
		For cold messages, I prefer email; everyone has one, and I am okay with my address being fairly public.
		I already aggresively filter for spam, so a bit more isn't a big deal.
		I do recommend not sending messages that look like spam; I won't respond, and I will block your address.
		Also, I can only guarantee that a message sent to the exact address in the above link will reach me.
		I store which randomly-generated address were created and when.
		I default block addresses that haven't actually been generated.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I can say that I will see a non-spam email message within 1 business day.
		I don't guarantee when I will respond, or even if I will.
		Messages are answered by importance, and to be blunt, cold emails are never going to be at the top of that list.
		This does also assume I am not on vacation, which will clearly change this policy.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Other Ways</h2>
	  <p>
		You can use any of these methods, but I can't ballpark how long it will take for me to see them.
		I include them here to have a reference to all my related accounts.
