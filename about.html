		<h2>This Site</h2>
		<p>
		  Its your average blog, for now.
		  I have some ideas that I want to try eventually, but right now I just want to have somewhere to post the things I write.
		  A main point of this site is experimenting with various ideas I want to try.
		  So it will probably change a far bit.
		  I don't strictly hold to only talking about particular topics, but most will be related to tech.

		<h2>Me</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been programming on and off for ~4 years, and messing around with Linux for ~8 years.
		  I enjoy diving into a subject for a bit and then not touching it for a year.

		<h3>My Opinions Disclaimer</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything I write on this blog is my opinion and my opinion alone.
		  I mean it might be someone else's opinions as well, but I have no clue about that.

		<h2>Asked Questions</h2>
		<h3>What does 'Asgi' mean?</h3>
		<p>
		  Its a reference to a character in the <a href="https://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section4/tr4802.htm">Kesh Temple Hymn</a>, one of the 2 oldest surving works of literature in the world.
		  I've had a fair amount of interest in Sumerian history and literature over the years.
		  I am also a big fan of alliteration and symmetries in names.
		  So when I was trying to come up with a pseudonym, I thought it seemed decent.
		  I also find it funny that the character is praised as such an amazing hero in each verse, but the only thing he actually does in the text is drink some wine.
		  For reference, the other oldest work is the <a href="https://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section5/tr561.htm">Instructions of Shuruppak</a>.
