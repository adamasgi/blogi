				I've read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching">Tao Te Ching</a>, <a href="https://www.organism.earth/library/document/tao-te-ching">link to my preferred artistic translation</a>, but very little else around it.
				I've heard its good and wanted to give it a try.
				I am a few chapters in and it seems well-written, but rather basic.

				I've had some cursory interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">Geoism</a>, an economic theory focused on taxing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent">Economic Rents</a>, which are a distinct concept from the colloquial concept of rent. I've just started it, so no opinions yet.
