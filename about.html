		<h2>This Site</h2>
		<p>
		  Its your average blog, for now.
		  I have some ideas that I want to try eventually, but right now I just want to have somewhere to post the things I write.
		  I don't strictly hold to only talking about particular topics, but most will be related to tech.

		<h2>Me</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been programming on and off for ~4 years, and messing around with Linux for ~8 years.
		  I enjoy diving into a subject for a bit and then not touching it for a year.
		</p>
		<h3>My Opinions Disclaimer</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything I write on this blog is my opinion and my opinion alone.
		  I mean it might be someone else's opinions as well, but I have no clue about that.
