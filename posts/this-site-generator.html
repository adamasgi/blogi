		  <h2>Why write my own?</h2>
		  <p>
			The main reason is that I want to have a project to learn a new language, see below for my current options.

		  <h2>What Language should I write this in?</h2>
		  <p>
			I have pretty specific requirements for this tool.
			My main language is Python, but I have been trying to find a better language for a while.
			Python isn't a bad language, but its design decisions no longer fit generally with me.

		  </p>
		  <h3>Go</h3>
		  <p>
			Go is the most okay language I kinda know, and that's genuinelly not a diss.
			Its simple and easy to learn; there usually feels like there's one way to do things in it.
		  </p>
		  <h3>Nim</h3>
		  <p>
			I've dicked around with	Nim a few times, and kinda liked it.
			I definitely prefer the Python-like syntax to a C-style, not as good as S-Expressions but we can't always have nice things.

		  </p>
		  <h3>Zig</h3>
		  <p>
			Zig is my language crush; I think about it a lot, but I don't ever do anything about it.
			Its the language I know the least out of these languages.
