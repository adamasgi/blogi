		  <h2>Bitorrent as an Internet Replacement</h2>
		  <h3>Core</h3>
		  <h4>A lot of unusued storage space exists on people's devices</h4>
		  <h4>The cloud is </h4>
		  <h3>Youtube Replacement</h3>
		  <p>
			Bitorrent is already commically more efficient at data transfer then HTTP.
		  </p>
		  <h4>The How</h4>
		  <h5><a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0046.html">Mutable Torrents | BEP 46</a></h5>
		  <p>
			<a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0049.html">Torrent Feeds | BEP 49</a>

		  </p>
		  <h4>Sub Ideas</h4>
		  <ul>
			<li>Preload videos from subscribed/selected feeds
			  <div>
				On video sites, the hosting requirements for a video varies significantly through the lifetime of the video.
				The first hr, day and week of a video will almost certainly have more downloads and views then the 23 week.
				So preloading new videos for your subscribed feeds/channels would have 2 significant benefits.
				The first is for this particular end-user; no buffering and potentially higher quality videos.
				The second is for platform as a whole.
				Bitorrent downloads from multiple peers at once, so the more peers the faster and more reliable the download.
				This particular preloading would also provide these extra peers at the most important times in the video's life, the first 1hr and day.
